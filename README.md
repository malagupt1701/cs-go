Counter-Strike Global Offensive or CSGO is a team-based video game that is among the most popular ones in the e-sport scene. With growing organizations and sponsors backing the players, the top teams have their own game ‘analyst’ whose task is to study the opponents and come up with the best in-game strategies. Data generated from thousands of matches can help viewers understand the game, and shape how future teams are going to play strategically.

In the book we explain how we processed our data and gave our findings with graphs and interactive components.

## Data used
 
 We used in game data from all Major matches. Majors are Valve sponsored events for CS:GO where only the top teams can participate.
